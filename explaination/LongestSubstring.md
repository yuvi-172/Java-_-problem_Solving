# Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
## Problem Statement
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

## Intuition
A brute-force O(n²) solution checks every substring.  
Instead, we use a *Sliding Window* approach.

## Approach
1. Use a *HashSet* to track unique characters.
2. Maintain two pointers (left and right).
3. Expand right while elements are unique.
4. If a duplicate is found, remove elements from left until unique.
5. Update max length.

## Complexity Analysis
- *Time Complexity:* O(n) → Each character is processed once.
- *Space Complexity:* O(n) → Stores characters in a HashSet.
